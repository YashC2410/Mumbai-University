We have implemented an Mumbai University Project for providing user an virtual presentation as well as analytical resarch that how an website performs operations.
We Have Used HTML5 and CSS3 in order to provide an realitical representation to the user using it.
It also consist of PHP Coding in order to store details in a database,and retrieve the data as requested by the user.
It consist of a Main Page which have included Staff Login for Staff of the University , an Student Record Page in order to obtain the student record stored along University and a Result Page in order to display the result based on name entered instead of rollnumber for an different view.
Java Script is also used along for checking whether the input driven by user satisfies the data type required or not.
It also provides an alert message of not proper data.
The  code is pure HTML for linking Sites and different pages ,providing Header to Required and important data, adding images to easily the understand the sector present.
CSS3 for providing style to login page and result page for making it user friendly and also a way of making the page attractive.
The Project is executed using XAMPP Server through which MYPHP which is an database provided by server ,that store the data and is assesed by th PHP Code present.
The file needs to be copied in to th folder present within th htdoc folder of the xampp folder.
For executing the project we need to first open the XAMPP server, then on the MYApache and MySQL in order to make database usable.
After that open your browser and type localhost:8080 url in order to open xammp on you browser.
Once XAMPP opens up in the browser ,http://localhost/th/index.html and type the url in order to Open Your Site in to browser.
Once site is attained it can be used as per user requiresemnts.
The Project is simple to understand and use as well as ,because there are no complexity present along the project,which makes it less understandable.
